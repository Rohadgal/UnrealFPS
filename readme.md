# Multiplayer Game
This project is a multiplayer online game developed in Unreal Engine 4.15, following a tutorial by John Galt. If this game is run while the Steam platform is open, it allows players to host and join a game online. This game includes two sets of weapons, a gun and a rifle, and as special features added by the participants of this project, there are different types of grenades and a thermal vision pickup. The grenades can be a slowing grenade, a flash grenade, or an explosive grenade randomly awarded.
